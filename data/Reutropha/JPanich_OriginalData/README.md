# Notes on the Excel file from Justin Panich 

The growth curves (first tab) are OD600. The endpoint measurements in variable CO<sub>2</sub> OD550. If you want to represent the data as OD600, you can multiply the A550 numbers by 0.86 (derived from experimental data, n=12). 

The growth curves (first tab) are in 10% CO<sub>2</sub>, 80% H<sub>2</sub>, 10% O<sub>2</sub>. The endpoint measurements (second tab) are in varying amounts of CO<sub>2</sub> (as indicated) with 60% H<sub>2</sub> and 10% O<sub>2</sub>, balance atmosphere. Kanamycin was present at 100 µg/mL throughout all experiments.

Induction conditions are marked in red in the spreadsheet. 

# Preculture conditions 

All cultures were precultured in LB with 10% CO<sub>2</sub> in the headspace. I did not use formate for any of these experiments but I have recently tried a preculture with 80 mM Na-formate in the LB (to induce rubisco) at 0.5% CO<sub>2</sub> and formate makes no difference in my experiments.

Hi Eli, 

Here is the completed data set without arabinose.  As you can see, dab2 and HCAII still have quite a lot of activity without induction.  I did the pRFP/WT experiment twice (total n=6) to verify the result as it is very important for our interpretation of the data.  It looks like there is tremendous action at 1.5% CO2 and 0.5% CO2.  pDAB/WT actually grew better relative to pRFP/WT without induction.  This is sort of mirrored in my heterotrophic growth experiment: pDAB/WT grows fine in heterotrophic conditions if not induced, but you see a growth defect when inducing with arabinose in pDAB/WT in heterotrophic conditions.  

I looked back at the methods section I wrote for the manuscript and found that two things have changed in the protocol since the initial experiments were done:
1) no NaOH to pH the media to pH 7, and media was left at pH 6.7.  This media has a high buffer capacity and required extreme quantities of NaOH to reach pH 7 and the media is already 100 mM Na+ without pH’ing the media as it is a sodium phosphate based media.  

2) no addition of atmospheric air as this has lead to over pressuring in continued experiments.  It seems that the vacuum line leaves ~20% atmospheric air in the bottles.  The O2 content during autotrophic growth is therefore ~14%.  In the initial experiments I had added 25% atmospheric air, bumping up the oxygen content to ~20%.  While the hydrogenase in C. necator is oxygen-tolerant, it is not oxygen-resistant and hydrogenases prefer 0% oxygen. 

I think the initial experiments were compromised due to a combination of high Na+ content as well as higher O2 concentrations which caused the cultures to grow to maximum OD550 of only 0.5-0.8, obscuring our interpretation of the the results.  I find this new data to be very exciting and I am proud of this work. 

Please find the data attached.

# Notes on the Excel file from Justin Panich 

The growth curves (first tab) are OD600. The endpoint measurements in variable CO<sub>2</sub> OD550. If you want to represent the data as OD600, you can multiply the A550 numbers by 0.86 (derived from experimental data, n=12). 

The growth curves (first tab) are in 10% CO<sub>2</sub>, 80% H<sub>2</sub>, 10% O<sub>2</sub>. The endpoint measurements (second tab) are in varying amounts of CO<sub>2</sub> (as indicated) with 60% H<sub>2</sub> and 10% O<sub>2</sub>, balance atmosphere. Kanamycin was present at 100 Âµg/mL throughout all experiments.

Induction conditions are marked in red in the spreadsheet. 

# Preculture conditions 

All cultures were precultured in LB with 10% CO<sub>2</sub> in the headspace. I did not use formate for any of these experiments but I have recently tried a preculture with 80 mM Na-formate in the LB (to induce rubisco) at 0.5% CO<sub>2</sub> and formate makes no difference in my experiments.
